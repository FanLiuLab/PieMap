# PieMap<br>
## Data from 1000 Genome Project
#### a. You can obtain the genotype data and the coordinates for 26 sampling sites from the official website: https://www.internationalgenome.org/data#download. (Note: This script only supports files in PLINK format.)
#### b. You can connect us (Email: liufan@big.ac.cn) to obtain the genotype data in PLINK fromat (.bed,.bim,.fam) and the coordinates for 26 sampling sites.<br>
## Introduction of script (More details in PlotPieMapPDF.R)
#### This script can calculate the allele-frequency for SNPs using data of 1000 Genome Project and generate the csv file that is prepared for Mapviewer software. And can draw the map plot of worldwide allele-frequency distributions for SNPs using R. Please make sure the installation of r package ("rworldmap").
